<h3>Description</h3>  

<p>The Bio-Hazard is a HAZARDOUS creature and should avoided as much as possible, if you see this creature then run, if you cant run from it then hide, if you cant hide from it then pray for a miracle because of how dangerous this creature can be.  It is called The Bio-Hazard because of how radioactive it is, it can melt anything in its path including you if it wanted to, it is extremely fast as well so dont be fooled by its size, it may be the size of a pine tree but its swift movements can slice anything in half.  It also leaves scratch marks on trees indicating that it was there once.  Their territory is mainly a forest where theres plenty of animals it can feed on.</p>
