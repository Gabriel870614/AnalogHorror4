<h3>Description</h3>  

<p>The Lurker is a HAZARDOUS creature and should be avoided at all times, this mysterious creature seems to be able to teleport because everytime someone encounters this creature it will vanish into thin air.  But people who arent so lucky with their encounter does not make it out alive because of the creatures sharp claws and horns growing out of their body.  Theyre much faster than the average human running up to 37mph, they also seem to have night vision so it gives them an advantage against its prey.  Their territory is currently unknown at the time since they usually just vanish without a trace so theres not much info on them.</p>
