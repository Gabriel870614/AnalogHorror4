<h3>Description</h3>  

<p>The Ravager is a HAZARDOUS creature and should be avoided as much as possible.  These creatures are similar to bears, their territory is mainly in the woods but sometimes theyll live in the cities, not many though.  Their strength matches as a gorrila but they dont look very muscular so dont be fooled by its looks.  Its pointy tounge is so sharp it can pierce human skin like its nothing, and if you get stung by one of these tounges it can infect you and become very ill.  It can also live in swamps too because of its gills.</p>
