<h3>Description</h3>  

<p>The Haunting is a HAZARDOUS creature that should be avoided at all times.  This creature is extremly dangerous and should not be approached within 100 feet, it seems its vision is not as good as ours and we havent figured out why, its appearance almost looks like that of a ghost and we dont know if it is actually dead and that it use to be human or not, we still dont know to this day.</p>
